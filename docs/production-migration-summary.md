# Production Migration Summary

This document summarizes all changes made to prepare Tiger.Chat for production deployment.

## 1. Environment Configuration Improvements

- Added XAI_API_KEY to serverRuntimeConfig in next.config.ts
- Added REDIS_URL to serverRuntimeConfig in next.config.ts
- Created `.env.production.template` as a guide for production environment variables
- Created verification script (`scripts/setup-production-env.sh`) to check environment setup

## 2. API Model Integration Fixes

- Added XAI API key validation to chat route to prevent runtime errors
- Added XAI models (`xai-chat` and `xai-reasoning`) to the schema validation
- Added XAI models to models.ts definition

## 3. Error Handling Improvements

- Enhanced file upload error handling with better error messages
- Improved security by adding user-specific file paths for uploads
- Added proper error handling with sanitized messages for production

## 4. Next.js Configuration Optimizations

- Enabled React strict mode for better error detection
- Disabled X-Powered-By header for security
- Enabled Progressive Page Rendering (PPR) for production builds
- Added image optimization with AVIF and WebP formats
- Configured standalone output for Docker deployments

## 5. Deployment Infrastructure

- Created Docker Compose configuration for production
- Added production Dockerfile with multi-stage build process
- Created comprehensive production deployment guide

## 6. Build Process Enhancements

- Added dedicated production build script (`pnpm build:production`)
- Added pre-deployment verification script (`pnpm verify:env`)
- Created combined production preparation command (`pnpm prepare:production`)
- Added test command for XAI model testing

## 7. Security Improvements

- Added unique file path prefixes for uploaded files to prevent collisions
- Added proper error redaction in production mode

## Outstanding Recommendations

1. **API Rate Limiting**: Consider implementing rate limiting for all API endpoints
2. **Error Monitoring**: Set up a production error monitoring system (e.g., Sentry)
3. **Logging**: Implement structured logging for production
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add performance monitoring with Vercel Analytics or similar
5. **Database Optimization**: Review and optimize database queries for production load
6. **Security Scanning**: Run a security scan before final deployment
7. **Load Testing**: Perform load testing before public launch

## Next Steps

1. Review the production deployment guide
2. Configure your production environment variables
3. Deploy to production using Vercel or Docker
4. Verify all functionality in production environment
5. Set up monitoring and alerting
