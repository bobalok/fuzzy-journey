2. Add the API key to your `.env.local` file
3. Run the test script to verify functionality: `pnpm tsx scripts/test-openrouter.ts`
4. Run E2E tests if needed: `pnpm test tests/e2e/openrouter.spec.ts`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the OpenRouter integration, please check:

1. That your API key is valid and has been added to `.env.local`
2. That the `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` package is installed
3. That the models you're trying to use are available in your OpenRouter plan
4. Check the OpenRouter status page if API requests are failing
